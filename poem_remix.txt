And that has made all the difference.
We took the one less traveled by,
Two roads diverged in a wood, and We—
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
We shall be telling this with a sigh

We doubted if We should ever come back.
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
Oh, We kept the first for another day!
Wen leaves no step had trodden black.
And both that morning equally lay

Had worn them really about the same,
Though as for that the passing there
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
And having perhaps the better claim,
Then took the other, as just as fair,

To where it bent in the undergrowth;
And looked down one as far as We could
And be one traveler, long We stood
And sorry We could not travel both
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

I reversed the order of the poem and I replaced all the 'I's with 'we'.
